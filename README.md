# Register Allocation using Graph Coloring

This project demonstrates **Register Allocation** using the **Graph Coloring Algorithm**, a fundamental optimization technique in **Compiler Design**.

---

## Project Overview

Register allocation is the process of assigning program variables to a limited number of CPU registers to improve execution efficiency.  

This implementation simulates how compilers minimize memory usage by:

- Performing **Liveness Analysis**
- Constructing an **Interference Graph**
- Applying **Graph Coloring**
- Assigning registers efficiently
- Handling spilling (if required)

---

## Algorithm Workflow

1. Perform liveness analysis on variables.
2. Build an interference graph.
3. Apply graph coloring.
4. Assign registers based on available colors.
5. Spill variables if registers are insufficient.
